Hi! I'm **Gerald Villaran** and I made this LLM App as requirement for my **CoDev** application for the Senior ML App Engineer position.

**Installation:**
 1. Clone repository
 2. Install dependencies using: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**Section 5: Programming Task**
**LLM App Using Langchain.** Design a chatbot application using the Langchain library. The chatbot should be capable of responding intelligently to user prompts. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the architecture.

**Section 4: Programming Task**
**Memory Query System.** Implement a memory query system in the LLM that can retrieve the history of chat and reference it for future responses. Discuss the benefits and potential drawbacks of this feature.
